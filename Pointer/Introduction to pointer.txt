          When we declare a variable,the variable allocate a memory address.

          Pointers are variables that store address of another variable.

              int a;
              int *p;    /// pointer variable.
              p = &a;     /// p contains address of a.
              a = 5;
              print p    /// address of a.
              print &a   /// address of a.
              print &p   /// address of the pointer variable.
              print *p   /// the value(a=5) its points (It's called dereferenceing)
    
              p = address.
              *p = value at address.
